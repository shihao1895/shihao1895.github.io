<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Hao Shi (石昊), a third-year Master's student in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, in a joint program with MEGVII Research, advised by Prof. [Gao Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-P9LwcgAAAAJ) and [Xiangyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yuB-cfoAAAAJ), and I also work closely with [Tiancai Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YI0sRroAAAAJ). 

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from the College of Intelligence and Computing at Tianjin University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Di Lin](https://dilincv.github.io). 

My research interests lie primarily in **Embodied AI, Robot Learning, VLA, and 3D Perception**. I am dedicated to exploring foundation models for general robotic systems. 

<span style="color:red;">
I am looking for <b>Ph.D. opportunities for 2026 Fall in Embodied AI</b>. 
I would be truly thankful for any advice, recommendations, or opportunities. 
Here is my <a href="images/THU_Hao_Shi_CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV.</a>
You may kindly reach me at <a href="mailto:shihao1895@gmail.com">shihao1895@gmail.com</a> or via WeChat (u1s11024)

**[MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://shihao1895.github.io/MemoryVLA)**

**Hao Shi**, Bin Xie, Yingfei Liu, Lin Sun, Fengrong Liu, Tiancai Wang, Erjin Zhou, Haoqiang Fan, Xiangyu Zhang, Gao Huang✉
<!-- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19236)  |  [Project](https://shihao1895.github.io/MemoryVLA) -->
- MemoryVLA is a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for robotic manipulation inspired by human memory systems. It builds a hippocampal-like perceptual-cognitive memory to capture the temporal dependencies essential for current decision-making, enabling long-horizon, temporally aware action generation.

**[DenseGrounding: Improving Dense Language-Vision Semantics for Ego-centric 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04965)**

Henry Zheng\*, **Hao Shi\***, Qihang Peng, Yong Xien Chng, Rui Huang, Yepeng Weng, Zhongchao Shi, Gao Huang#✉
- DenseGrounding is a framework for embodied 3D visual grounding. It tackles the loss of fine-grained visual semantics from sparse fusion of point clouds with multi-view images, as well as the limited textual semantic context from arbitrary instructions, enabling more accurate and context-aware grounding.

**[SpatialActor: Exploring Disentangled Spatial Representations for Robust Robotic Manipulation]()**

**Hao Shi**, Bin Xie, Yingfei Liu, Yang Yue, Tiancai Wang, Haoqiang Fan, Xiangyu Zhang, Gao Huang✉
- SpatialActor is a disentangled framework for robust robotic manipulation. It decouples perception into complementary high-level geometry from fine-grained but noisy raw depth and coarse but robust depth expert priors, along with low-level spatial cues and appearance semantics.

Tingliang Feng\*, **Hao Shi\***, Xueyang Liu, Wei Feng, Liang Wan, Yanlin Zhou, Di Lin✉
- We propose object style compensation for open compound domain adaptation. It builds an object-level discrepancy memory bank to capture fine-grained source–target domain gaps and compensates target features to align with source distribution, enabling cross-domain segmentation.
